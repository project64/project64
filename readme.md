You can download the latest Public Stable build [Here](http://www.pj64-emu.com/downloads/project64/binaries/)  
If you want to try the current version (Possibly Not-So-Stable build), you can either Build it yourself or download it from the project64 forum [Here](http://forum.pj64-emu.com/forumdisplay.php?f=10), just PM zilmar for permission.


###Building Instructions
Building Project64 requires a copy of Visual Studio 2010 or later, 2015 Recommended, running on XP or newer, as well as a git client. I am going to assume you are using a command line git application.

To start with, clone the project (git clone https://github.com/project64/project64.git) and then to build, open Project64.sln, wait for it to load, then make sure you have the the right settings for your build selected,  
generally Win32 and Release, then click Build. Once the build is done, copy Project64.cfg.development and rename it to Project64.cfg.
