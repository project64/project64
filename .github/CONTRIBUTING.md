2. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch.
  * Choose a meaningful name for the branch (e.g. `fix`, `documentation`).
3. Commit any changes onto your new branch.
4. If sensible, squash all commits into one. This helps clean up the vetting process.
  * Ensure that commit messages are clear, concise, and informative. They should include information about all changes made, especially when squashing multiple commits into one.
5. Once all commits have been made and squashed, rebase all changes in your branch.
  * Rebasing will resolve any merge confilcts that your changes may cause.
6. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch
  * The pull request should be descriptive and include all changes made to the code base. If multiple files have been changed, organize them such that they can be easily followed by a reviewer.
  * Make sure that you **allow edits** by maintainers when making the Pull Request.
7. Your changes should be reviewed and fixes may be made to your changes.
  * If fixes are made please make sure to address them.
