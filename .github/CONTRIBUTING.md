3. Commit the changes made on your new branch
4. If senisible, squash all of your commits into one. This will help clean up the process of vetting.
  * Esnure that commit messages are clear, consice, and infromative. They should include information about all changes made especially if you've squash multiple commits into one.
5. Once all commits have been made and squashed, rebase all changes in your branch.
  * Rebasing will resolve any merge confilcts that your changes may present
7. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch
  * The Pull request should be descriptive including any and all changes made to the code base. If multiple files have been changed, then organize the changes in a manner that is easy for a reviewer to follow.
  * Make sure that you **allow edits** by maintainers when making the Pull Request
8. Your changes should be reviewed and fixes may be made to your changes.
  * If fixes are made please make sure to address them
