        Please read the support document in this repository before opening an issue!


        If you are having issues with a plugin that isn't included with or
        supported by the Project64 team, we cannot support you other then pointing
        you to the developer or repository for those plugins.


        Please join the Discord first and ask questions and ask for support there
        first. If the issue should require an open GitHub issue, somebody will ask
        you to open one. 
        
        We have a lot of people in the Discord who are more then
        happy to help you with any issues you may be having!


        Please avoid opening issues if you do not meet the minimum requirements
        for Project64. These are outlined in the README for this repository.
