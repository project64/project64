\chapter*{Executive Summary}

The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (OSNAP) has made a substantial investment in a mech defense system titled Kirby. 
As part of the acquisition, a simulation system Super Smash Bros. (SSB) was provided for training our Kirby effectively.
K-AID is an artifical intelligence engine we will create to control Kirby in SSB.

K-AID will gather information directly from the simulation's memory space about Kirby and the opponnent.
Included in this information is location, velocity, acceleration, enemy action-state, damage dealt, and finally life loss.
Using this information about state and reward, K-AID will determine a correct action to take in order to maximize future reward (i.e. destroying the enemy without loss of life).
The primary technique will be reinforcement learning to construct a deep nueral network.
