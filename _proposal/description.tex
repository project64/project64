\chapter*{Project Description}

We will build an artifical intelligence (AI) actor that can play Super Smash Bros. (SSB) as the character Kirby.
The end-of-term goal is to be able to defeat an average human opponents in real-time.
Our AI engine will perform a major computation to determine the best next action for Kirby given the current state and action. 
Our target performance is to be able to calculate the next action of the AI engine per frame. 
This means we want to perform this AI work approximately 30 times per second or at a rate of $33ms$ per engine output.
We will achieve this performance through parallelization of the AI engine.
