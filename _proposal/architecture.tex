\chapter*{Highlevel Architecture}

Development will be performed on the Windows platform using Visual Studio 2015.
We will base our project off of the open source Project64 emulator.
Modifications will be made to the emulator for the process of state gathering and enacting actions.
An independent AI library (SSBAI) will be constructed to perform the AI calculations and ultimately decide what action Kirby will take.

Below is a serial psuedocode perspective of all of the tasks that must be completed per frame.
This is in essence the critical path of our implementation.
\begin{verbatim}
Emulator.processInputs(ControllerInputs);
Emulator.updateGameState();
State = StateGatherer(Emulator.memory);
State.preprocess();
NextAction = SsbaiEngine.predict(State);
ControllerInputs = ActionPusher(NextAction);
\end{verbatim}

Below is the overlying software architecture which indicates the data flow.

We explode this data flow to reveal critical tasks that are completed per frame.
