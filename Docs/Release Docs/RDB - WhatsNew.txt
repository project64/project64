Removed (actually commented out):
Jet Force Gemini (U) [f1]			Reason: bad rom.


*I think the average PC is now fast enough to turn this off in the RDB.
(i've known for a long time that ABL Off was smoother in the Zeldas, but loses perhaps 20% speed).
If your machine is not fast enough to maintain 60Vi/s, probably a good idea to turn it back on.
Some chance this affects stability, as not as many people have been playing them with ABL Off.
