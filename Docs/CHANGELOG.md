# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This is only for the Windows version of the emulator. For the Android changelog, refer to the [Android changelog](../Docs/CHANGELOG-ANDROID.md).

Minor note: Before version 4.0, the changelog didn't exist, and the changelog that did exist that was implemented after version 2.3.2 was very basic and version history before that was 99% guessed. So after 4.0 we hope for that to change!
