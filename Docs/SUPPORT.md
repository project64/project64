### Hello, this document is to help you out if you are looking to get support for Project64.

#### First of all, GitHub issues are ***not*** for general inquiries, support questions, or anything that can be handled on our support Discord. Issues opened without first reading this document or attempting to get support in the Discord will be closed. Issues opened regarding software we don't maintain will also be closed.

#### Here is a non-exhaustive list of things you should do before asking for help on the Discord:

- Make sure you are using either the latest stable version of Project64, or the latest nightly build of Project64
- Make sure you aren't using a bad ROM dump
