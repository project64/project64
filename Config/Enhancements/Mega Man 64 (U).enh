Name=Mega Man 64 (U)

$WTF? Sixty?!?
Note=Too fast,uses the game rate addresses that are oddly defaulted to 02 this time,so Mega Man 64 actually runs at half speed.
Stunning to see a game natively do this by default,audio stays the same but gets cut short due to faster speeds.
This needs a slowdown code to accompany its overly-fastness.
